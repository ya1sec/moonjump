    <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
    <p>
      I have bad news. This collection of hypertext elements has been
      solicited by those seeking to learn about my life and unfinished
      business. They wish to make an employee out of me.

      I run a multidisciplinary solo practice that goes by the name
      <a href="https://ya1sec.com" target="_blank" class="y1s">ya1sec</a>,
      where I wear the following hats:

      Lately, I've been exploring the domain of Natural Language Processing
      and working on a miniature piece of software called
      <a href="https://github.com/ya1sec/korpis" target="_blank" class="proj">KORPIS</a>
      that aims to be a friend to poets. Heaps of text are generated by Markov
      Models trained on austere corpora, leaving poets to use the cutup method
      to create works with the results. I'm writing a neverending poem called
      <a href="https://ya1sec.com/ioah.html" target="_blank" class="proj">Impression of an Hour</a>
      in collaboration with an experimental version of the program.
